# Backpack-Price-Predictor
🎒 ML-powered Backpack Price Predictor | Flask API + Bootstrap Frontend | Kaggle-trained Random Forest Model

An intelligent, machine learning-powered web app that predicts backpack prices based on user-selected features like brand, material, number of compartments, and more.  
This project was inspired by a **Kaggle competition** and built with **Python, Random Forest**, and a sleek **Flask + Bootstrap frontend**.
